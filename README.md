This program shows how truncation and rounding affect the value of π at 20, 40, 60, and 100 decimal places. Truncation drops extra digits, while rounding adjusts the last digit based on the next one. These approximations are used to calculate the volume of a sphere using the formula V = 4/3 π r^3 with the radius of 1, and the results are compared numerically and visually .

Summary of Findings

The code compares truncation and rounding of π at 20, 40, 60, and 100 decimal places and uses these values to compute the volume of a sphere. The results show that truncation and rounding always produce slightly different values, but the difference becomes extremely small as precision increases. Rounded values are consistently closer to the true volume than truncated values. At high decimal places, both methods give nearly identical results in practice.
